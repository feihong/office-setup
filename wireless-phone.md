## Call blocking

When listening to a dumb robocall or other unwelcome call, press the CALL BLOCK button on the bottom of the handset. Note that this doesn't work for calls that have no number.

To block calls that have no number, take a handset that isn't being used for a call, press the CALL BLOCK button, and select Block unknown CID > Block.
