## Call blocking

### Block a number that is currently calling 

Press the CALL BLOCK button on the bottom of the handset. Note that this doesn't work for calls that have no number.

### Block calls with no number

While no call is being taken, press the CALL BLOCK button, and select Block unknown CID > Block > Save. Note that the phone will still ring once when a blocked number calls, but it will automatically disconnect after the first ring.

### View blocked numbers

Press CALL BLOCK button, select Block a single number.
